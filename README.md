# Arctic-Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Benchmark
This repository contains PyTorch implementations of deep reinforcement learning algorithms and environments for Robotics and Controls.  The goal of this project is to include engineering applications for industrial optimization. I reproduce the results of several model-free and modelbased RL algorithms in continuous and discrete action domains.
